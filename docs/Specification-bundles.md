# Specification Bundles

## Overview

Specification Bundles are a powerful feature of the Product Specifications plugin that allows you to group related specifications together for easy application to similar products. This feature streamlines the process of adding specifications to products, ensuring consistency across your product catalog.

## Understanding Specification Bundles

A Specification Bundle is a pre-defined set of specifications that typically apply to a specific category or type of product. For example, you might create a "Laptop" bundle that includes specifications like processor type, RAM, storage capacity, and screen size.

## Creating a Specification Bundle

To create a new Specification Bundle:

1. Navigate to your WordPress admin panel.
2. Go to "Product Specs" > "Specification Bundles" in the left sidebar.
3. Click the "Add New Bundle" button at the top of the page.
4. Fill in the following fields:
   - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the bundle (e.g., "Laptop Specifications", "Smartphone Features").
   - **Slug**: This will be automatically generated based on the name, but you can modify it if needed.
   - **Description**: (Optional) Add any additional information about this bundle.
5. In the "Specifications" section, you'll see a list of all available specifications.
6. Check the boxes next to the specifications you want to include in this bundle.
7. (Optional) Reorder the specifications by dragging and dropping them into the desired order.
8. Click "Publish" or "Update" to save the bundle.

## Managing Specification Groups Within Bundles

Specification Bundles allow you to organize specifications into groups for better organization and display:

1. While editing a bundle, look for the "Add New Group" button.
2. Click it to create a new group.
3. Give the group a name (e.g., "Performance", "Physical Characteristics").
4. Drag and drop specifications into the group.
5. Create as many groups as needed to organize your specifications logically.

## Editing a Specification Bundle

1. Go to "Product Specs" > "Specification Bundles".
2. Find the bundle you want to edit in the list.
3. Click on the bundle name or the "Edit" link.
4. Make your changes in the edit screen:
   - Modify the name, slug, or description.
   - Add or remove specifications.
   - Reorder specifications or groups.
   - Add, remove, or rename groups.
5. Click "Update" to save your changes.

## Deleting a Specification Bundle

1. Go to "Product Specs" > "Specification Bundles".
2. Hover over the bundle you want to delete.
3. Click the "Delete" link that appears.
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

Note: Deleting a bundle will not delete the individual specifications or remove them from products where they've been used.

## Using Specification Bundles

Once you've created Specification Bundles, you can use them in several ways:

1. **Applying to Products**:
   - When editing a product, look for the "Specification Bundle" dropdown in the "Product Specifications" meta box.
   - Select the appropriate bundle for your product.
   - The product will be populated with all the specifications from the chosen bundle.

2. **Quick Edit**:
   - In the products list, you can use the "Quick Edit" feature to rapidly assign a Specification Bundle to a product.

3. **Bulk Edit**:
   - Select multiple products in the products list.
   - Choose "Edit" from the Bulk Actions dropdown.
   - In the bulk edit interface, you can assign a Specification Bundle to all selected products at once.

## Best Practices for Specification Bundles

1. **Create Bundles for Common Product Types**: Identify the most common types of products in your store and create bundles for each.

2. **Use Clear, Descriptive Names**: Make sure your bundle names clearly indicate what type of product they're for.

3. **Group Related Specifications**: Use the grouping feature to organize specifications logically within a bundle.

4. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically review your bundles to ensure they contain all relevant specifications and remove any that are no longer needed.

5. **Start Broad, Then Refine**: Begin with more general bundles, then create more specific ones as needed. For example, start with a general "Electronics" bundle, then create more specific ones like "Smartphones" or "Laptops".

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Specification Bundles:

1. Ensure all individual specifications in the bundle exist and haven't been deleted.
2. Check that the bundle slug is unique.
3. Verify that you have the necessary permissions to create and edit bundles.
4. If problems persist, check the plugin's support forum or contact support for assistance.
