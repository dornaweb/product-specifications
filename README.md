The specification table is under a div with `.dwspecs-product-table` CSS class and you can customize it in your CSS files.

You can use `[specs-table]` shortcode to display specs table.


### How to fully customize the HTML markup of the table

Copy the file `/inc/views/shortcode-table-view.php` file somewhere in your theme and add the below code to your functions.php file

```
add_filter('dw_specs_table_shortcode_output', 'my_custom_spec_table_markup', 10, 2 );
